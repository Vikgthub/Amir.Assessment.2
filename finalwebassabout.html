        <h1>About Celeste</h1>
        <p>
          Founded in the spirit of elegance, innovation, and boundless imagination, <strong>Celeste</strong> is a fictional automotive brand created to reimagine what cars could be in a world where creativity meets precision. Though it exists only in pixels and code, Celeste represents a vision — a brand born from the stars and designed for those who crave the extraordinary on every road they travel.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            <strong>Celeste</strong> — a name that means "sky" in Spanish — is more than just a fictional car company. It is a vision of elegance, freedom, and celestial beauty. Created as part of a digital design project, Celeste represents the intersection of imagination, design, and storytelling, brought to life through code and creativity. The brand stands as a symbol of what cars could be in a world unconstrained by limits — where engineering meets artistry, and innovation flows like starlight.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Every Celeste model is carefully named and imagined to echo the timeless beauty of the stars, planets, and ancient myths. Drawing inspiration from Latin and Greek, names like <em>Caelum</em> (sky), <em>Stella</em> (star), <em>Luceat</em> (to shine), and <em>Nox</em> (night) bring a deeper poetic layer to each vehicle. These names are chosen not just for their sound, but for the stories and emotions they evoke — mystery, movement, light, and power.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Celeste sedans, coupes, cabriolets, SUVs, hatchbacks, and wagons are designed as if they were sculpted from the sky itself. From the refined Celeste Asteri to the bold Celeste Volare, each concept car is an expression of personality, freedom, and fluid motion. The models aren’t just imagined machines — they’re imagined experiences. They exist to inspire: a bridge between technology and the heavens.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Though Celeste is not a real-world manufacturer, it embodies the creativity, branding, and design thinking that drives real innovation. This brand exists in a digital space — built for an academic project — but grounded in real design principles. It was developed to showcase web development skills, content strategy, and visual storytelling.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Celeste is a reminder that creativity knows no bounds. It asks: What if we could drive the stars? What if imagination had wheels? This is Celeste — a brand born of dreams, inspired by the cosmos, and designed for minds that love to explore.
          </p>

        <p>
          Each vehicle in our imagined portfolio is named with celestial themes, creating a brand identity that feels elevated, graceful, and timeless. Our design philosophy revolves around blending the artistic with the technical, where each curve of the chassis reflects sophistication and each feature is conceived to make a bold, unforgettable statement. Though we don’t build engines or weld frames, we build stories — and Celeste is a story of bold dreams and limitless possibility.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The fictional world of Celeste is not bound by commercial trends or production limitations. Here, innovation isn’t just a buzzword — it's the foundation. We imagine a world where vehicles adapt to the driver’s personality, where style and substance coexist seamlessly, and where every drive is more than a journey — it’s an experience. Whether you're driving the elegant Celeste Asteri sedan through imagined city streets or cruising in the sun-drenched Celeste Stella cabriolet along dreamlike coastlines, Celeste brings that world to life through digital imagination.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This brand was created as part of an educational web development project to explore how design, branding, and storytelling can elevate a simple website into something meaningful. While Celeste may not exist in the real world, the passion, creativity, and skill behind it are very real. We invite you to explore our models, services, and story — and experience Celeste, a brand made of dreams, code, and the limitless sky.
